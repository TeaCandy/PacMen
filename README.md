# PacMen
## PacMen Exercise
<p> The purpose of this exercise was to cement my understanding of the for loop function, as well as draw upon the relative postions of moving objects using the velocity of x and y while accounting for collision. Other functions utilized were setTimeout, push(), and setToRandom. </p>

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
<p4> Some general debugging. I noticed that the PacMen sometimes spawn on top of the buttons, making it impossible to click them if the game is paused. I'd also love to add a ghost collision detection where the PacMen organically despawn if they collide with a ghost. </p4>
