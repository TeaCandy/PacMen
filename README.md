## PacMen Exercise
<p> The purpose of this exercise was to cement my understanding of the for loop function, as well as draw upon the relative postions of moving objects using the velocity of x and y while accounting for collision. Other functions utilized were setTimeout, push(), and setToRandom. </p>
